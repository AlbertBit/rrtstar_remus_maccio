all the important stuff is contained into src and MATLABCodes
The two files rrts_main_ostacles.cpp and rrts_main_object_size.cpp found in the src folder were introduced only for further testing and simulations, therefore they do not add any functionality to the algorithm. In case you desire to compile them, we suggest to create a copy of the workspace
